# IBC-Integration

The Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable,
ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology.
xCall, a standard for generic cross-chain messaging along with IBC provides dynamic and coherent solution for
interconnected dapps.

Additional information on how IBC works can be found [here](https://ibc.cosmos.network/). and xCall spec is
defined [here](https://github.com/icon-project/xCall/blob/main/docs/adr/xcall.md)

## About <a name = "about"> </a>

Relayer for these contracts deviates slightly from official cosmos relayer due to the fact that ICON uses BTP Blocks as storage for messages and also on cosmwasm side the ibc host is deployed as contracts rather than the native ibc host module of cosmos chain. Relayer for ibc-icon can be found [here](https://github.com/icon-project/ibc-relay).
The deviation from cosmos relayer is documented [here](https://github.com/icon-project/ibc-relay/blob/main/docs/deviations_from_ibc.md).

## Local Setup And Runnning Tests Using DIVE CLI

For Setting up nodes , deploy contracts and end-to-end testing follow steps provided [here](./docs/ibc-setup-using-dive-cli.md)

## Build <a name = "build"> </a>

Run following command on root directory to build the rust contracts. The built wasm files will be available in the artifacts directory in the root.

```
./scripts/optimize-cosmwasm.sh
```

To build the java contracts run following command.

```
make optimize-jar
```

To build all contracts using docker follow steps below
Step1: Update git submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

Step2: Run following commands to build the builder image and compile contracts.

```
make build-builder-img
make optimize-build

```
