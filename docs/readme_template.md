### Prerequiste

<!-- What things needed to install the software and how it is installed.
```
Examples
``` -->
To go with the flow of the project, we should install some softwares.

- To install Rust in Linux and Mac,

First, [install rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Once installed, make sure you have the wasm32 target:
  
```shell
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.55.0+, update
rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

For windows,
Download and run, [rustup-init.exe](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe)

### Running the tests

## Usage <a name = "usage"> </a>

IBC stands for Interblockchain Communication Protocol, which have been widely used to allow direct communication and asset trading between independent blockchains.

The Cosmos ecosystem has a vision of creating the "internet of blockchains," or a network of independent chains that can communicate in a decentralized way. To reach this goal, the Inter‚ÄêBlockchain Communication protocol (**IBC**) was created.

As part of the CosmosSDK-based ecosystem, Icon integrates the IBC protocol to Archway, our CosmWasm smart contract-based decentralized exchange with multi-chain interoperability, optimal speed and lots of liquidity options for users.
