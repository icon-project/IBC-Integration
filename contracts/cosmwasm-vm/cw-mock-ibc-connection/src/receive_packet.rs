    ///
    /// * `deps`: `deps` is a `DepsMut` object, which is short for "dependencies mutable". It is a
    /// struct that provides access to the dependencies needed by the contract to execute its logic.
    /// These dependencies include the storage, the API to interact with the blockchain, and the querier
    /// to query data
    /// * `message`: The `message` parameter is of type `IbcPacket` and represents the packet received
    /// by the contract from another chain. It contains the data sent by the sender chain and metadata
    /// about the packet, such as the sender and receiver addresses, the sequence number, and the
    /// timeout height.
    ///
    /// Returns:
    ///
    /// a `Result` object with either an `IbcReceiveResponse` or a `ContractError`.
