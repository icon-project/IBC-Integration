/// `InstantiateMsg` struct. It represents the block height at which the transaction will timeout if it
/// has not been included in a block by that height. This is used to prevent transactions from being
/// * `ibc_host`: `ibc_host` is a field of type `Addr` in the `InstantiateMsg` struct. It likely
/// represents the address of the IBC host that the message is being sent to. However, without more
/// context it's difficult to say for sure.
