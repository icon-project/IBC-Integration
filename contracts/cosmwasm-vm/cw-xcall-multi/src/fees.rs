    ///
    /// * `deps`: `deps` is a `DepsMut` or `Deps` object that provides access to the contract's
    /// dependencies such as storage, API, and other modules. `DepsMut` is used when the function needs
    /// to modify the state of the contract, while `Deps` is used
    /// * `info`: MessageInfo is a struct that contains information about the message being executed,
    /// such as the sender's address, the amount of coins being sent, and the gas limit. It is provided
    /// by the Cosmos SDK to the contract's entry points.
    /// * `value`: The `value` parameter in both functions represents the amount of protocol fee to be
    /// set or retrieved. It is of type `u128`, which means it can hold a large unsigned integer value.
    /// The protocol fee is a fee charged by the contract for executing certain operations or
    /// transactions on the blockchain.
