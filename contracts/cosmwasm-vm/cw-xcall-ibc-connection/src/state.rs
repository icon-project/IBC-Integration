/// * `sequence`: The `sequence` property is an unsigned 128-bit integer that represents the sequence
/// number of the IBC transaction. It is used to ensure that transactions are processed in the correct
/// order and to prevent replay attacks.
/// * `src`: `src` is a property of the `IbcConfig` struct that represents the source endpoint of an
/// Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) transaction. An IBC endpoint is a unique identifier for a
/// blockchain network that can send or receive IBC packets. It typically includes information such as
/// the chain ID
/// * `dst`: `dst` is a property of the `IbcConfig` struct and represents the destination endpoint of an
/// Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) transaction. It is of type `IbcEndpoint`, which likely contains
/// information such as the chain ID, address, and port of the destination chain.

/// Properties:

/// * `last_sequence_no`: A field of type `Item` that stores the last sequence number used in a call
/// service message.
/// * `last_request_id`: This is a field of type `Item<'a, u128>` which stores the last request ID used
/// by the `CwIbcConnection` struct. The `Item` type is a wrapper around a value that can be stored in a
/// persistent storage, and the `'a` lifetime parameter indicates that
/// * `owner`: The `owner` property is a `String` type field that holds the address of the owner of the
/// `CwIbcConnection` struct.
/// * `admin`: `admin` is a field of type `Item<'a, String>` in the `CwIbcConnection` struct. It is a
/// reference to a string that represents the address of the admin of the call service. The `Item` type
/// is a wrapper around a reference to a value of a
/// * `message_request`: A map that stores CallServiceMessageRequest structs with a u128 key.
/// * `requests`: `requests` is a `Map` that stores `CallRequest` objects with a `u128` key. This map is
/// used to keep track of all the call requests made by the users of the `CwIbcConnection` struct. The
/// `u128` key is used to uniquely identify
/// * `ibc_config`: This property is of type `Item<'a, IbcConfig>` and represents the IBC configuration
/// for the call service. It is likely used to define the parameters and settings for inter-blockchain
/// communication.
/// * `fee_handler`: The `fee_handler` property is an `Item` that holds a `String` value. It likely
/// represents the address or identifier of the entity responsible for handling fees associated with the
/// `CwIbcConnection` struct.
/// * `fee`: `fee` is a field of type `Item<'a, u128>` in the `CwIbcConnection` struct. It is a reference
/// to an item of type `u128` that represents the fee for the call service. The `Item` type is a wrapper
/// around a reference to
/// * `ibc_host`: `ibc_host` is a field of type `Item<'a, Addr>` in a struct called `CwIbcConnection`. It
/// is likely used to store the address of the IBC host that the `CwIbcConnection` interacts with. The
/// `Addr` type likely represents a network
/// * `timeout_height`: The `timeout_height` property is an `Item` that stores the timeout height for
/// the Call Service. This is the block height at which the Call Service will stop processing requests
/// if they have not been completed.
