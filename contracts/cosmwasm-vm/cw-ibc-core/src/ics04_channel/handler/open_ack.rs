///
/// * `message`: A reference to a `MsgChannelOpenAck` struct, which contains information about the
/// acknowledgement of a channel opening message.
/// * `chan_end_on_a`: `chan_end_on_a` is a reference to a `ChannelEnd` object representing the state of
/// the channel on the "A" side (i.e. the side that initiated the channel opening handshake). This
/// object contains information such as the channel ID, the counterparty channel ID, the connection hops
///
/// Returns:
///
/// a `Result` type with either an `Ok(())` value indicating that the validation was successful, or an
/// `Err(ContractError)` value indicating that the validation failed with a specific `ContractError`
/// type.
