    ///
    /// * `deps`: `deps` is a mutable reference to the dependencies of the contract. It allows the
    /// contract to interact with the blockchain state and other contracts.
    /// * `info`: `info` is a struct that contains information about the message being processed, such
    /// as the sender's address, the amount of tokens being sent, and any attached data. It is of type
    /// `MessageInfo`.
    /// * `timeout_msg_type`: A variable of type `TimeoutMsgType` that represents the type of timeout
    /// message being validated. It can either be `Timeout` or `TimeoutOnClose`.
    ///
    /// Returns:
    ///
    /// a `Result<Response, ContractError>` where `Response` is a struct representing the response to a
    /// message and `ContractError` is an enum representing the possible errors that can occur during
    /// contract execution.
