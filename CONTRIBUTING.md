## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check **[our list of issues](https://github.com/icon-project/ibc-integration/issues)** to see if an
issue already exists.

> **Note:** For existing issues, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new issue. If the issue is closed and
> the problem persists, please open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please fill out [the required template](https://github.com/icon-project/ibc-integration/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md) and include as many details as possible.

### Contributing Code

If you want to contribute, start working through the IBC-Integration repository, navigate to the Github "issues" tab and start looking through issues. We recommed issues labeled "good first issue". These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for newcomers. If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.

Please see the [ICON Foundation Development Guidelines](https://github.com/icon-project/community/blob/main/guidelines/technical-development/development-guidelines.md)
for information regarding our development standards and practices.

### IBC-Integration Core Development Process

This section is intended for developers and project managers that are involved with core IBC-Integration.

After the developer working on the branch determines the feature (or fix) branch satisfies the acceptance criteria of the associated issue and has sufficiently tested the added code, the developer should submit a pull request with at least 1 reviewer assigned for the feature branch to be merged into the main branch.

After the pull request has been merged, the feature branch should be deleted and the issue should be closed.
